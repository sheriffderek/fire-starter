  <h1>Welcome to {{applicationName}}</h1>

  <p>Every time I start an Ember project, I install these things. Since we don't have brunch.io style skeletons, I'll be keeping this base app up to date–at least LTS for now–so that I don't need to go through these motions any more.</p>

  <p>I have to say up-front, this is going to have all it's style rules written in stylus.</p>

  <p>I'm sure no one will even see this, but just in case... this is version 0.0.1 - and I'm just getting it going. I'd say it's 1/10th of what I expect it to be. <a href='https://twitter.com/sheriffderek'>@sheriffderek</a></p>

  <p>The following is in order of importance:</p>
