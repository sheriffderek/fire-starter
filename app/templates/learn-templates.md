Looking at app.js I see this: `import Application from '@ember/application`; What is `@ember` where is it? Where is that application.js file?

When to use  './thing'  '@ember/thing'  or 'thing' with the imports.

How do I know what all the @ember/things are - and when to use them?

Not everyone knows ES6 - or has worked on a project of this size. We'll do well to just explain it really clearly.

### Templates & Controllers

You could - have one template and one controller / and have a working application / but then you might as well use something like Vue.js. However, these are likely the first thing you should understand. You could skip routes and get data from outside apis without routes... but it wouldn't be very fun.


### Styles

### Components

You're going to want to use these... even if there is just one 'page'.


### Routes

You might just have a static brochure site that uses the route hooks to make really cool animations - and no apis or data whatsoever.
