##An Emberjs skeleton
Not anywhere usable yet
[http://fire-starter.surge.sh](http://fire-starter.surge.sh)

This repo aims to arm you with all the basics to build small-screen-first, responsive layouts and skip the boilerplate setup that I always encounter in each new project. I build lots of short-term Ember apps, so - you may not relate - but I need to have something like a brunch.io skeleton to get things rolling. I'll try and keep it tight, but I have opinions - and they are going to be evident here. Stylus for example, is the only preprocessor I'll be working with.
