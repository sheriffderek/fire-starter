# fire-starter


## An Emberjs skeleton + some ideas on how to learn Ember

You could use it... but it's not 1.0.0 or anything exactly. It's meant to be forked - or cloned. Maybe later I'll version the style rules. But this is just a jumping off point.

- _**Living style guide**_ demo: [http://fire-starter.surge.sh](http://fire-starter.surge.sh)

- _**Learn Ember**_ demo: [http://learn-ember-demo.surge.sh](http://learn-ember-demo.surge.sh)


### Choose your own adventure (_branch_)

1. [live-style-guide](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter) - The addons you'll almost always install + a thoughtful set of style rules to get right to work + a starter style guide

2. [learn-ember](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter/tree/learn-ember) - a readme for each building block, and clear examples of each of the main concepts

3. [basic](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter/tree/basic) - just the style rules - for other types of projects
