# fire-starter: - Learn Ember


## Install the project - and Look at the fill structure

In theory... you could dig around in this app's straight forward file structure / _see the examples_ - and read each _README_ in say: `app/components/learn-components.md`  --- and have a solid example of the standard use-cases for each building block - and see how they are connected. I'd also like to include a set of challenges to offer - so that you can solidify your understanding.

### Choose your own adventure (_branch_)

1. [live-style-guide](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter) - The addons you'll almost always install + a thoughtful set of style rules to get right to work + a starter style guide

2. [learn-ember](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter/tree/learn-ember) - a readme for each building block, and clear examples of each of the main concepts

3. [basic](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter/tree/basic) - just the style rules - for other types of projects
