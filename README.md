# Basic


## A set of style rules - written in stylus

Just a carefully selected set of style rules that have served me well. Not a framework / just a way of thinking. Just grab then and try them out.

I'll create an index with some examples:


### Other things to do: Choose your own adventure (_branch_)

1. [live-style-guide](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter) - The addons you'll almost always install + a thoughtful set of style rules to get right to work + a starter style guide

2. [learn-ember](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter/tree/learn-ember) - a readme for each building block, and clear examples of each of the main concepts

3. [basic](https://github.com/sheriffderek/fire-starter/tree/basic) - just the style rules - for other types of projects
