# fire-starter

## An Emberjs skeleton + some ideas on how to learn Ember

You could use it... but it's not 1.0.0 or anything exactly. It's mean to be forked - or cloned. Maybe later I'll version the style rules. It's just a jumping off point.

### Choose your own adventure (_branch_)

1. `live-style-guide` - The addons you'll almost always install + a thoughtful set of style rules to get right to work + a starter style guide

2. `learn-ember` - a readme for each building block, and clear examples of each of the main concepts

3. `basic` - just the style rules - for other types of projects
